  @Summary
    Sends a 10us pulse to the TRIG pin

  @Description
    This function sends a 10us pulse to the TRIG pin for the purposes of distance measurement.

  @Preconditions
    Initialize the TMR0 before calling this function.

  @Param
    None.

  @Returns
    None.

  @Summary
    Handles ECHO IOC events

  @Description
    This function handles IOC interrupts when the ECHO pin changes to high or low. Furthermore,
    this function will stop and start the timers accordingly

  @Preconditions
    Initialize the TMR0 before calling this function and that sendTrigger has
    been invoked.

  @Param
    None.

  @Returns
    None.

  @Summary
    Calculates the distance from the stored timerTicks variable for the AJ-SR04M
    distance sensor.

  @Description
    This function will calculate the distance given by the distance sensor using
    the speed of sound.

  @Preconditions
    sendTrigger and handleEcho have already timed a ECHO pulse.

  @Param
    None.

  @Returns
    Double representing the distance in cm
